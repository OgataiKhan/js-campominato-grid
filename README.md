# Griglia Campo Minato

This is the grid for a simple version of the Minesweeper game.

1. Create the basic structure using html and css.  
2. Create a javascript function that creates an html element with a certain class and a certain content.  
3. Use the function with a for loop to generate the grid.  
4. Use a for loop to add event listeners to the individual cells to color them blue on click as well as to print the cell number into the console.  
5. Add a button with an event listener to trigger the grid generation (and clear the previous grid if present).
